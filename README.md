# Flow Architecture Overview

Flow is a decentralized coordination platform enabling agents and users to co-create, manage, and reward knowledge, tasks, and compute in a verifiable, local-first environment.


## Core Principles

1.  **Local-first + Verifiable:** Data and computation start locally.
2.  **Capability-Based Access:** Authentication and authorization is decentralized. Permissions use UCANs (User Controlled Authorization Networks).
3.  **Knowledge Graphs with Provenance:** Data is stored in schema-aware graphs tracking origin and trust.
4.  **Peer to Peer networking:** Agents and users connect and coordinate via a decentralized network.
5.  **Decentralized Execution:** Execution is local-first, workflows can be distributed and executed in a decentralized manner.
6.  **Agent Explainability (SLRPA):** Agents operate on a Sense → Learn → Reason → Predict → Act cycle.
7.  **Programmable Incentives:** Rewards and reputation are customizable and trackable.


## Layered Architecture

1.  [**Storage Layer**](./specs/01_storage_layer.md): Implements the local-first, persistent storage using CRDTs over content-addressed systems (like IPFS/BadgerDB).
2.  [**Access & Auth Layer**](./specs/02_access_auth_layer.md): Manages identity (DIDs) and permissions using capability-based systems like UCANs.
3.  [**Network Layer**](./specs/03_network_layer.md): Handles peer-to-peer discovery, communication, data synchronization, and transport, secured by the Auth Layer (UCANs).
4.  [**Coordination & Sync Layer**](./specs/04_coordination_sync_layer.md): Ensures state consistency across different agents and nodes using the underlying CRDT mechanisms.
5.  [**Knowledge Graph Layer**](./specs/05_knowledge_graph.md): Provides the semantic context (KG) for data.
6. [**MCP Layer**](./specs/06_mcp.md): Defines how external models/tools (via Model Context Protocol) interact with user content.
7.  [**User Interface / UX Layer**](./specs/07_ui_ux_layer.md): Provides the means for users to interact with the system, inspect the graph, manage agents, delegate tasks, etc.
8.  [**Agent Layer**](./specs/08_agent_layer.md): Manages agent lifecycles (Sense→Learn→Reason→Predict→Act) and ensures their actions are explainable.
9.  [**Execution Layer**](./specs/09_execution_layer.md): Handles the definition and running of workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), managing signed state transitions.
10.  [**Compute Layer**](./specs/10_compute_layer.md): Executes the actual computational tasks defined in the Execution Layer, potentially using various backends (local, distributed like Bacalhau) and supporting verifiable computation.
11. [**Incentive Layer**](./specs/11_incentive_layer.md): Defines and manages programmable rewards and contribution tracking based on provenance data in the knowledge graph.


## Flow of Activity

1.  Create/update objects (CRDT deltas, sync DAG).
2.  Sign with DIDs, governed by capability tokens.
3.  Discover and connect to Flow network.
4.  Grant access control and permissions to objects.
5.  Users can spin up Agents connected to their knowledge graphs. 
6.  Agents execute via SLRPA (Sense → Learn → Reason → Predict → Act).
7.  Results logged, verified.
8.  Rewards triggered by provenance/policy.
9.  Explore via graph UI.



## Running the Codebase

This project uses a Makefile to simplify common development tasks. The Makefile is designed to handle multiple binary packages within the Rust workspace.

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed
- Make utility

### Available Commands

#### Package-Specific Commands

These commands require specifying a package using `pkg=<package_name>`:

```bash
# Run a specific package
make run pkg=<package_name>

# Build a specific package (development)
make build pkg=<package_name>

# Build a specific package (release/optimized)
make build-release pkg=<package_name>
```

#### Workspace-Wide Commands

These commands operate on the entire workspace:

```bash
# Run all tests across the workspace
make test

# Check all packages for compilation errors
make check

# Clean all build artifacts
make clean

# Display help information
make help
```

### Available Packages

The following packages are available in this workspace:

- `node` - Main node implementation
- `entity` - Entity definitions
- `errors` - Error handling
- `event` - Event system
- `storage` - Storage core functionality

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Run the main node
make run pkg=node

# Run with debug logging
make run pkg=node LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Run with custom log configuration
make run pkg=node LOG_LEVEL=node=debug,sqlx=warn

# Build the node for development
make build pkg=node

# Build the node for production
make build-release pkg=node

# Run all tests
make test

# Check for compilation errors
make check

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Environment Variables

- `LOG_LEVEL` - Controls logging verbosity (default: `info`)
  - Can be set to standard levels: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`
  - Supports per-crate configuration: `crate1=level1,crate2=level2`

### Getting Help

To see all available commands and usage information:

```bash
make help
```

This will display detailed usage instructions and examples for all available commands.
